One moment please while I look into this for you.
You at 15:10, Aug 11:
ok
Representative Ana at 15:11, Aug 11:
Your request was reviewed by an options principal and they decided to leave at level 1 for now
You at 15:12, Aug 11:
we are in training with Juan Villegas
Representative Ana at 15:12, Aug 11:
Ok
You at 15:13, Aug 11:
that's why we need Level 3
You at 15:13, Aug 11:
or at least Level 2
Representative Ana at 15:13, Aug 11:
Unfortunately, due to the liquid networth they decided to leave the account at Level 1
You at 15:15, Aug 11:
and what operations can I do there?
Representative Ana at 15:15, Aug 11:
write covered calls and buy protective puts
You at 15:15, Aug 11:
longs?
Representative Ana at 15:16, Aug 11:
I do not understand the question. With level 1 you can only sell covered calls and buy protective puts
You at 15:17, Aug 11:
and how much should i add to the account to be at least level 2
Representative Ana at 15:17, Aug 11:
It is not related to the account balance
You at 15:18, Aug 11:
ok, and in how long could they give me level 2
Representative Ana at 15:18, Aug 11:
I do not have an answer for that unfortunately
Representative Ana at 15:19, Aug 11:
Please allow a couple more months before you re-apply
